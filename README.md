### 1. Project-oriented workflow using RStudio, 18th Jan 2024

This session starts with a beginner friendly introduction to [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and shows how to get the most out of a project-oriented workflow.
We will discuss good coding practices when setting up a project, e.g., using the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/), [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), and [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) packages and how to add a licence to your project with [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/licenses.html).
Don't worry if you've never looked at the technical documentation of R packages, we'll also guide you through these and discuss how to find the relevant information.
The chapter on [Workflow: scripts and projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html#projects) from the 2nd edition of R for Data Science (R4DS) is a good introduction to RStudio projects.
