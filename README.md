# PHC Coding Club

We aim to organise Coding Clubs fortnightly. At first all sessions will be guided (_Guided Coding Club_, for details see schedule below), but as time goes by we will mix in some open (_Open Coding Club_) sessions.
During the _guided_ sessions someone from the group introduces a new tool or topic and during the _open_ sessions we discuss the previous sessions or just code together on our own projects.

## Guided sessions

## Optional pre-session reading

If you are completely new to R or would like to quickly refresh your knowledge before attending your first session, we have prepared some resources for you.

[Sheet 1: The Very Basics of R for Data Analysis](resources/Sheet1.md)

[Sheet 1a: Basics of R (Appendices)](resources/Sheet1a.md)

More of these to come!
