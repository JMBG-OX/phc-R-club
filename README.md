# PHC Coding Club

Coding Clubs are organised weekly, with alternating guided (_Guided Coding Club_) and open (_Open Coding Club_) sessions.
During the _guided_ sessions someone from the group introduces a new tool or topic and during the _open_ sessions we discuss the previous sessions or just code together on our own projects.
